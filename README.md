# 🎯 School Shooting Prevention - Sales Enablement Analysis 

A SQL-based business intelligence project quantifying prevention opportunities in school shooting incidents.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes 177 school shooting incidents from 1999-2019 to identify patterns that enable data-driven sales strategies. The analysis reveals that **71% of school shooters are current students**, proving behavioral monitoring platforms address the majority of threats versus physical security that only addresses external risks.

**The Challenge**: School safety tech companies face 9-12 month sales cycles and less than 20% close rates due to inability to prove ROI.

## 🎯 Key Results

* **71.2% of shooters were current students** - High prevention opportunity through behavioral monitoring
* **80.2% were minors under 18** - Intervention authority exists
* **42.9% occurred in ages 14-16** - Optimal intervention window identified
* **53.6% of weapons from family/home** - Safe storage education opportunity
* **95% male pattern stable across 20 years** - Reliable benchmarking for alert systems

## 🔍 Research Questions Answered
